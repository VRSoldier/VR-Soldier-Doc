Developed VR environments recreate the actual war scenes in virtual, yet safe world. This way, soldiers get trained on the 3D mapped VR area before going to the actual operations

#### Virtual Reality Trainings 
> Trainings before war, recreating dangerous, life-threatening environments while providing a safe environment, also capturing performance of soldiers

#### 3D Mapping with Virtual Reality 
> 3D modelling of the area and training on mapping information before operations

#### Medic applications of VR war environments
> Usage in the rehabilitation of war caused psychological conditions 

### Global Expected Growth in VR Market 
100 B
